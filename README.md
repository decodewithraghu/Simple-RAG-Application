## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Document Upload**:
   - User selects a collection and uploads a PDF/TXT file
   - Backend extracts text from the document
   - Text is split into chunks (1000 chars with 200 char overlap)
   - Each chunk is converted to embeddings using sentence-transformers
   - Embeddings are stored in collection-specific FAISS vector index
   - Metadata includes document ID, filename, chunk index, and text

2. **Querying**:
   - User selects a collection and submits a question
   - Question is converted to an embedding
   - FAISS searches only the selected collection's index
   - Finds the most similar document chunks using L2 distance
   - Retrieved chunks (with metadata) are sent to Ollama as context
   - Ollama generates an answer based on the context
   - Answer, sources, similarity scores, and statistics are returned

3. **Collection Partitioning**:
   - Each collection has its own FAISS index
   - Searches only within selected collection (faster and more accurate)
   - Collections can be created on-the-fly during upload
   - Allows organizing documents by topic, department, version, etc.

4. **PWA Functionality**:
   - Service worker caches static assets
   - Offline access to previously loaded pages
   - Install prompt for native app experience
   - Background sync capabilities

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Application won't start
- Run `./start-all.sh` from the project root
- Check logs at `/tmp/rag-backend.log` and `/tmp/rag-frontend.log`
- Ensure ports 8000 and 3000 are available

### Ollama not available
- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check if the model is pulled: `ollama list`
- Pull the model if missing: `ollama pull llama2`

### Dependencies missing
- Backend: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install`
- Or use `./start-all.sh` which installs automatically

### Backend errors
- Check Python version: `python3 --version` (requires 3.8+)
- Verify .env file exists in backend directory
- Check `/tmp/rag-backend.log` for detailed errors

### Frontend can't connect to backend
- Ensure backend is running on port 8000
- Check REACT_APP_API_URL in `frontend/.env`
- Verify CORS settings in `backend/main.py`

### PDF upload fails
- Check file size (default max 10MB)
- Ensure PDF contains extractable text (not scanned images)
- Verify sufficient disk space

### Collection not showing documents
- Ensure documents were uploaded to the correct collection
- Refresh the database viewer
- Check backend logs for errors

### PWA not installing
- Use HTTPS or localhost
- Check if browser supports PWA (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for manifest errors

## 📝 Notes

- The application uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for embeddings (automatically downloaded on first use)
- FAISS indices are persisted in the `faiss_db/{collection_name}` directory
- Each collection has its own index and metadata
- Uploaded files are stored in the `uploads` directory
- All directories are created automatically
- FAISS provides very fast similarity search and is compatible with all platforms
- Service worker caches static assets for offline access
