Programming Concepts Guide

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
1. Encapsulation - Bundling data and methods that operate on that data
2. Inheritance - Creating new classes from existing ones
3. Polymorphism - Objects can take many forms and respond differently
4. Abstraction - Hiding complex implementation details

Data Structures:
- Array: Sequential collection of elements
- Linked List: Chain of nodes with pointers
- Stack: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure
- Queue: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure
- Tree: Hierarchical structure with nodes
- Graph: Network of connected nodes
- Hash Table: Key-value pair storage

Algorithms:
- Sorting: Bubble sort, Quick sort, Merge sort
- Searching: Binary search, Linear search
- Graph algorithms: Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS
- Dynamic programming: Memoization, tabulation

Design Patterns:
- Singleton: Ensures only one instance of a class
- Factory: Creates objects without specifying exact class
- Observer: Notifies multiple objects about state changes
- Strategy: Encapsulates algorithms for interchangeability
- Decorator: Adds behavior to objects dynamically

Programming Paradigms:
- Imperative: Step-by-step instructions
- Declarative: What to do, not how
- Functional: Functions as first-class citizens
- Procedural: Procedure-based programming
